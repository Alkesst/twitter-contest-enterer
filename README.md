Have you ever seen a tweet that looks like this?

Chances are you have. This program (written entirely in python) finds and retweets these types of tweets. It also automatically favorites the tweet if the word "favorite"/"fav" is in it, and/or it will follow the user if the word "follow" is in the tweet.

# Screenshots
Here it is running. As you can see it found the word "follow" in the first tweet so it followed the user.
Maybe it's just me but I think that's pretty cool.

Here is a picture of something it retweeted. It also followed this account (you don't see that though).

# Modules and code
It is all python 2.7 code, and the only modules it requires are 'time' (built-in) and 'Tweepy'
You can install Tweepy with

    pip install tweepy

and the github repo for it is here:

# Terms of use
Feel free to do whatever with it, but if you get in trouble with Twitter you'd better not get me in trouble too.
